# Waste Exchange System
**Description:**
Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Documentation for Waste Exchange System. This system is another initiative to save the world from pollution. The “Waste Exchange System” we propose will not only make waste materials collection more organized but also motivate people to collect and store their wastes rather than throwing them. Our system collects wastes like e-waste, plastics, papers, and rewards the waste provider according to the amount of waste. The wastes are then delivered to the waste-collecting companies. Since waste providers will be rewarded with goods in exchange for wastes they will be more enthusiastic to store their waste and benefit from them rather than throwing those random places.

**Benefits:**
- Since we propose reward against waste people will be more interested to collect their waste rather than throwing those here and there.
- People can dispose of their e-waste through our system which gives us a hazard-less environment.
- The recycling and manufacturing companies can get easy access to their raw materials through our system.
- Waste will be collected in an organized way so dumpster will not be necessary.
- Frauds cannot perform unethical works like cloning products from the wastes with poor quality as people will be more motivated to stock their used plastics for rewards.
